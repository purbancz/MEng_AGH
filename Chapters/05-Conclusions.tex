This thesis has addressed key limitations of the canonical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm by introducing and systematically evaluating a suite of novel diversity-enhancing strategies. These strategies include both single-role extensions---such as opposing-best, negative learning, and reverse learning mechanisms---and more sophisticated multi-hybrid frameworks that combine multiple roles within or across dedicated sub-swarms or probabilistically within individual particles.

Extensive empirical experiments conducted on a diverse collection of continuous benchmark problems, spanning a wide range of topological complexities and dimensionalities up to 1000 variables, provide compelling evidence that the proposed approaches significantly mitigate PSO’s well-known tendency toward premature convergence and stagnation in local optima. In particular, the HybridPartialDisjointPSO consistently demonstrates superior performance in terms of final solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness, outperforming both the canonical PSO and a basic perturbation-based diversity variant by a substantial margin. Equally noteworthy is the strong and consistent performance of variants leveraging attraction to worst strategies (e.g., DefeatistPSO and ContrarianDefeatistPSO), which achieve top results when performance magnitude is normalised, underscoring the value of informed, role-based exploration.

The results confirm that informed diversity---rooted in a deeper understanding of swarm dynamics and landscape characteristics---is markedly more effective than naïve perturbation or random diversification. Hybrid frameworks that orchestrate multiple behavioural roles simultaneously or across sub-swarms prove especially adept at balancing exploration and exploitation, adapting search behaviour to problem complexity, and scaling well with increased dimensionality.

While the thesis has demonstrated these advances on static, continuous test functions under fixed computational budgets, it also highlights promising directions for future work. These include extending the proposed frameworks to dynamic or combinatorial problems, investigating adaptive mechanisms for role activation or sub-swarm reconfiguration, and exploring further parameter self-tuning strategies to enhance robustness in real-world scenarios with limited a priori knowledge.


The core hypothesis of this thesis---that strategically designed roles can enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in PSO---is strongly supported by the results.
Standard PSO's susceptibility to early stagnation, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, is a well-documented consequence of an over-emphasis on exploitation once initial attractors are found. The poor performance of PerturbationPSO further suggests that undirected exploration is insufficient in most scenarios.

The designed roles systematically inject informed diversity into the swarm, balancing exploration and exploitation far more effectively than random perturbations. In isolation, roles like Contrarian, Rejector, or Defeatist introduce directional pushes away from known best or worst solutions, encouraging the swarm to probe neglected regions.
This enhanced performance stems from the core design philosophy of  hybrids: the systematic and dynamic integration of multiple "informed" diversity mechanisms. Unlike standard PSO, which relies solely on attraction to personal and global bests and is prone to premature convergence in complex landscapes, the hybrid models actively manage exploration and exploitation pressures. HybridPartialDisjointPSO, with its strategy of assigning distinct behavioral roles to sub-swarms, facilitates a parallel exploration of the search space, where different segments of the population can specialize in diverse search tactics. HybridAdditivePSO, allowing individual particles to concurrently express multiple behavioral influences, creates an exceptionally rich and adaptive search dynamic.

In summary, the novel hybrid PSO variants designed in this study demonstrate substantial and consistent improvements over standard PSO and simpler perturbation-based alternatives. The results underline the importance of role-based mechanisms for achieving effective exploration–exploitation balance, robust performance across diverse problem types, and scalability to high-dimensional search spaces. This provides a strong foundation for future research on adaptive hybrid PSOs, where roles and swarm partitioning could evolve dynamically in response to the landscape encountered during the search.
