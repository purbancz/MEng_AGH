The goal of the thesis is twofold: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To investigate various methods to enhance the exploration capabilities and population diversity of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
    \item To design, implement, and evaluate the hybridization of such strategies that effectively address these limitations, ultimately improving PSOâ€™s performance on complex optimization problems.
\end{enumerate}
